## Policies & General Information

- Late submissions: Acceptable up to 2 days with a penalty (10% per late day)
- Re-grading: 7 days available for re-grading requests
- Generative AI: Allowed as a learning aid; require disclosures along with the prompts used

## Software Engineering Principles

### Software Crisis & Engineering

- The "Software Crisis": Over-budget, over-time, inefficient, low quality, and not meeting requirements
- Software engineering brings systematic, rigorous, and measurable approaches to software development

### Software Engineering Activities

- **Specification**: Defining what the software should do
- **Development**: Producing the system
- **Evolution**: Responding to changing requirements or environments
- **Validation**: Ensuring the system meets needs and requirements

### Software Process Phases

- Different processes share similar elements but differ in organization
- Examples: Waterfall vs. Agile (Scrum)

### Software Engineering Fundamentals

- Managed development process for all software types
- Key aspects: Reliability and Performance

### Software Quality Assurance

- Frequent mobile app updates pose risks of new bugs; quality assurance aims to mitigate such risks
